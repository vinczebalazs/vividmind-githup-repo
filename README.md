**IMPORTANT**:

- To successfully run the screenshot tests use an iPhone 13 Pro Simulator running iOS 15.0.
- To make sure UI tests pass, it's important for the keyboard to be present on the screen, as the test fully exercises the UI similar to how a real user would. Before launching the tests, launch the app on the Simulator and click into the search bar, if the software keyboard does not appear, press CMD+K. Note that if you start typing in the Simulator using your physical keyboard, the software keyboard will dissapear and will need to be toggled again using the above method.
